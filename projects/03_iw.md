## Overview

Iron Warriors is a website presenting __the complete offer of a power building trainer__ Vašík. Its primary focus lies on online coaching, but you can also find information about in&#8209;person training, a blog or e&#8209;shop with his book and merchandise.

![Overview](./images/iw/iw_overview.jpg)

The client __asked us to redesign his website__ because his business has grown and broadened while the website got cluttered and __didn't reflect new business goals__. The project was realized by a digital agency MarketSoul.

  ## Research

  ### Understand users
  
  The target group for this project consists of __sports-orientated men in the 18–30 age range who want to improve their physical strength__. To understand them better, I interviewed a couple of them and noticed a pattern in their opinions.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column_15" style="margin-top: 15px;">
        <img alt="User" src="./images/iw/iw_user.png">
      </div>
      <div class="column_85">
          <h4>The site is confusing; it’s hard to navigate and find out what it’s suitable for them</h4>
          <h4>They work out in a gym by themselves or with a mobile app</h4>
          <h4>The appearance of the site looks too dull and unmotivating according to them</h4>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  ### Project Goals
  I combined the research result, the analytics from the old website and client’s business goals to define the project goals.

## Design a Solution

### Sitemap

With the project goals and users in mind, I sorted the content and added notes and ideas as it is shown in the simplified and detailed sitemap.

<div class="table">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="column_2">
      <h4>Simplified Sitemap</h4>
      <div style="margin-top:10px;">
        <img alt="Simplified Sitemap" src="./images/iw/iw_sitemap.png">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="column_2">
      <h4>Detailed Sitemap</h4>
      <div style="margin-top:10px;">
        <img alt="Detailed Sitemap" src="./images/iw/iw_sitemap_detailed.png">
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

### Wireframes

Using the sitemaps, I created wireframes and wireflows, where I explored the layout and made sure the experience is fluid and intuitive.
