## Overview

Iron Warriors is a website presenting __the complete offer of a power building trainer__ Vašík. Its primary focus lies on online coaching, but you can also find information about in&#8209;person training, a blog or e&#8209;shop with his book and merchandise.

![Overview](./images/iw/iw_overview.jpg)

The client __asked us to redesign his website__ because his business has grown and broadened while the website got cluttered and __didn't reflect new business goals__. The project was realized by a digital agency MarketSoul.

  ## Research

  ### Understand users
  
  The target group for this project consists of __sports-orientated men in the 18–30 age range who want to improve their physical strength__. To understand them better, I interviewed a couple of them and noticed a pattern in their opinions.
  
  <div class="table" style="margin-top: 55px; margin-bottom: 65px;">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column_3" style="margin-right: 50px; margin-top: 15px;">
        <img alt="User" src="./images/iw/iw_user.png" style="margin-top: 6px;">
      </div>
      <div class="column_57">
          <h4>The site is confusing; it’s hard to navigate and find out what it’s suitable for them</h4>
          <h4>They work out in a gym by themselves or with a mobile app</h4>
          <h4>The appearance of the site looks too dull and unmotivating according to them</h4>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  ### Project Goals
  I combined the research result, the analytics from the old website and client’s business goals to define the project goals.

## Design a Solution

### Sitemap

With the project goals and users in mind I sorted the content as it is shown in the simplified and detailed sitemap.
