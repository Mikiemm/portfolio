### Overview

DESIGN.S is a biennial international event which supports students of product and industrial design. Every two years, they entirely change visuals to appear modern and attractive to young people. While their visuals use to be eye-catching and work well, their web was confusing, hard to read or scan, and didn't look appealing. So I decided to change it!

### Design Goals
* encourage students to participate in the event
* make it easy to find relevant information
* inform and invite public
* bonus: create an attractive visual identity (you can see some examples at the end of this article)
