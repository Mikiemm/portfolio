### Overview

DESIGN.S is a biennial __international event which supports students__ of product and industrial design. Every two years, they entirely change visuals to appear modern and attractive to young people. While their visuals use to be eye-catching and work well, their web was confusing, hard to read or scan, and overall didn't look appealing. So I decided to change it!

### Design Goals
* encourage students to participate in the event
* make it easy to find relevant information
* inform and invite public
* _bonus:_ create an attractive visual identity (you can see some examples at the end of this article)

### My Responsibilities
* __UX Analysis__ (persona, flows)
* __Design__ (UI Design, visual identity)
* __Prototyping__ (Low to High Fidelity)
