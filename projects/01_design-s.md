## Overview

DESIGN.S is a biennial __international event which supports students__ of product and industrial design. Every two years, they entirely change visuals to appear modern and attractive to young people. While their visuals use to be eye-catching and work well, their web was confusing, hard to read or scan, and overall didn't look appealing. So I decided to change it!

### Design Goals
* encourage students to participate in the event
* make it easy to find relevant information
* inform and invite public
* create an attractive visual identity

### My Responsibilities
* UX Analysis _(persona, flows)_
* Design _(UI Design, visual identity)_
* Prototyping _(Low to High Fidelity)_

## User Research
Based on a couple of interviews with a target group (design students) I made a persona that you can view below.
