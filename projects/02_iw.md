#### Project

Iron Warriors is a website presenting __the complete offer of a power building trainer__ Vašík. Its primary focus lies on online coaching, but you can also find information about in-person training, a blog or e-shop with his book and merchandise.

![Overview](./images/iw/iw_overview.jpg)

The client __asked us to redesign his website__ because his business has grown and broadened while the website got cluttered and __didn't reflect new business goals__. The project was realized by a digital agency MarketSoul.

  ## Research

  ### Target Group

  ### Goals and Challenges
  * to present __a wide variety of services__ in a clear way
  * to create __a platform for online coaching__ based on subscription
  * to design __mobile-first__ _(this decision was based on the old website analytics and the fact that power building platform would be most likely used in gyms on mobiles phones)_
  * to add rougher and more masculine mood
