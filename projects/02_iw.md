## Overview
Iron Warriors is a web presenting __the complete offer of a power building trainer__ Vašík. Its primary focus lies on online coaching, but you can also find information about in-person training, a blog or e-shop with his book and merchandise.

The client asked us to redesign his web because his business has grown and broadened while the web got cluttered and didn't reflect new business goals. The project was realized by a digital agency MarketSoul.

### My roles
* UX Analysis _(persona, flows)_

* Prototyping _(low to high fidelity)_

### Goals and Challenges
* to present __a wide variety of services__ in a clear way
* to create __a platform for online coaching__ based on subscription
