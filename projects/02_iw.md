## Overview
Iron Warriors is a website presenting __the complete offer of a power building trainer__ Vašík. Its primary focus lies on online coaching, but you can also find information about in-person training, a blog or e-shop with his book and merchandise.

The client asked us to redesign his website because his business has grown and broadened while the website got cluttered and didn't reflect new business goals. The project was realized by a digital agency MarketSoul.
