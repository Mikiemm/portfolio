#### Project

Iron Warriors is a website presenting __the complete offer of a power building trainer__ Vašík. Its primary focus lies on online coaching, but you can also find information about in&#8209;person training, a blog or e&#8209;shop with his book and merchandise.

![Overview](./images/iw/iw_overview.jpg)

The client __asked us to redesign his website__ because his business has grown and broadened while the website got cluttered and __didn't reflect new business goals__. The project was realized by a digital agency MarketSoul.

  ## Research

  ### Understand users
  
  The target group for this project consists of sports-orientated men in the 20–30 age range who want to improve their physical strength. To understand them better, I interviewed a couple of them and noticed a pattern in their opinions.
  
<div class="table">
  
  <div class="row">
    <div class="column_2">
      <h4>Dlouhá věta o něčem zajímavém</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="column_2">
      <h4>Dlouhá věta o něčem velmi zajímavém</h4>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column_2">
      <h4>Dlouhá věta o něčem velice zajímavém</h4>
    </div>
  </div>
  
</div>

  ### Project Goals
  I combined the research result, the analytics from the old website and client’s business goals to define the project goals.
