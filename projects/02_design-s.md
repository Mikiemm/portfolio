## Overview

DESIGN.S is a biennial _international event which supports students of industrial and product design_. Every two years, they entirely change visuals to appear modern and attractive to young people. While their visuals use to be eye-catching and work well, their web was confusing, hard to read or scan, and overall didn't look appealing. So I decided to change it!

### Design Goals
* encourage students to participate in the event
* make it easy to find relevant information
* inform and invite public
* create an attractive visual identity

### My Responsibilities
* UX Analysis _(persona, flows)_
* Design _(UI design, visual identity)_
* Prototyping _(low to high fidelity)_

## User Research
To understand better for whom I'm designing, I conducted a couple of interviews with a _primary_ target group (industrial design students). Based on that, I made a persona you can view below.

_Secondary_, there is another target group – the visitors to the exhibition. These are usually man and woman from 20 to 50 years old with interest in art and design.

## User Experience

### User Journey
Using the persona and the competition schedule, I created a user journey. It helped me a lot to understand, when and in which context the web will be used.

The main decisions I made thanks to this journey are:

* the web will be mobile-first
* the content on the homepage will be changing in time because the goal of the web is changing in time

### Basic structure
* to inform students about the event and motivate them to participate
* to invite the public to vernissage and gala evening
* to invite the public to the exhibition, inform about winners

### User Flow with Blockframes
